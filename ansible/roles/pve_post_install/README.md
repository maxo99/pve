Credits - <https://github.com/marwan-belgueddab/homelab>

This Ansible role automates common post-installation tasks for a Proxmox VE server. It configures the system by setting up the no-subscription repository, performing system upgrades, removing the no-subscription warning, installing useful packages, enabling snippets content type, disabling IPv6, configuring DNS, and setting up basic Fail2ban for SSH.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Ansible role is to streamline and automate the initial configuration of a fresh Proxmox VE installation.  It addresses the need for a quick and consistent setup by performing essential post-install steps. This role helps users to:

* Easily switch from the Proxmox Enterprise repository to the No-Subscription repository.
* Ensure the system is up-to-date with the latest packages.
* Remove the nag screen associated with the No-Subscription repository.
* Install commonly used management and utility packages.
* Harden the system by disabling IPv6 and setting up Fail2ban for SSH protection.
* Configure DNS settings for proper name resolution.

## Tasks Performed

1. Remove Proxmox Enterprise subscription repositories.
2. Add the Proxmox PVE No-Subscription repository.
3. Perform a full system upgrade (distribution upgrade).
4. Remove the Proxmox No-Subscription subscription warning prompt from the web interface. [ CONSIDER BUYING A PROXMOX LICENCE ]
5. Install essential packages for Proxmox API access, management, and security (including `python3-proxmoxer`, `sudo`, `fail2ban`, and `python3-hvac`).
6. Enable the 'snippets' content type for Proxmox local storage to allow uploading snippets through the web interface.
7. Disable IPv6 system-wide.
8. Configure DNS servers in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
9. Configure Fail2ban for SSH with a default jail configuration.
